🚀 Model Architecture & Methodology
This project implements a high-frequency (15-minute interval) spatial-temporal forecasting model designed for energy/power grid data.
1. Data Processing Pipeline
Spatial Grid Mapping: The model extracts coordinates from raw metadata and maps them into a ranked geographical grid. This allows the model to treat different weather stations or sensing points as discrete "nodes" in a graph-like structure.High-Res Interpolation: To capture rapid fluctuations, hourly meteorological data is upsampled to a 15-minute frequency using Cubic Interpolation, ensuring smooth and realistic transitions between time steps.Feature Engineering: Beyond raw variables, the model calculates physical derivatives such as wind speed cubes (directly proportional to wind power potential) and log-transforms for variance stabilization.
2.  Temporal Logic: Window & Decomposition
The model utilizes a DLinear (Decomposition Linear) backbone to process time series:Lookback Window (Size 24): The model "sees" a 6-hour historical context (24 points $\times$ 15 min) up to and including the current forecast timestamp ($t$). This enables the model to utilize real-time weather forecasts to predict immediate energy output.Series Decomposition (Kernel 7): Within each window, the model employs a moving average kernel to split the signal into two distinct components:Trend Component: Captures the "inertia" and low-frequency drift (e.g., the steady rise in temperature from morning to noon). This prevents the model from being misled by instantaneous noise.Seasonal Component: Captures high-frequency fluctuations and sudden changes (e.g., rapid cloud cover shifts or wind gusts).
3. Spatial-Temporal Integration (DLNet)
Unlike standard time-series models, DLNet processes data across three dimensions:Feature Dimension: Non-linear transformation via Fully Connected Networks (FCN) and ReLU activation.Temporal Dimension: DLinear layers extract trend and seasonal patterns across the 6-hour window.Spatial Dimension (fcn_graph): A specialized linear layer with L1 Regularization acts as a spatial aggregator. It learns to "weight" the importance of different geographical locations, focusing on the most influential grid nodes for the final prediction.
4. Training Strategy
The model supports Rolling Training. It retrains on a 24-day lookback window prior to each prediction date to adapt to seasonal shifts and evolving weather patterns, ensuring the weights remain optimized for the most recent data distribution.
